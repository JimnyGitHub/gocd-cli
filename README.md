# gocd-cli

A command-line companion to GoCD. In its current state, it can only perform syntax checking for configrepo definitions. More to come later.

## Development

To build the `gocd` binary, run the `build.sh` command:

```
./build.sh
```

This will generate the `gocd` binary in the root folder.
